# Alarmclock


## TODO

Location fixes - it random chooses between local places for me and thats lame. misses time, wrong weather, etc.

Metric - C and F doesn't translate properly.

Watchdog timeout - reset in case of crashes. 

More settings - clicking would be nice to get more screens than just alarm on/off
